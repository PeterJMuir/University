ALG Assignment 2: "myShipFinder.java".

Algorithms used are mainly modified binary searches to grab necessary
values/indexes and Collections sort. The binary searches are re-written several times as they could not be
generalised due to the different values requiring different 'get' methods.
Collections sort is used throughout the program as it is reliable, stable (which
is important for keeping things in chronological order), and has a good average performance of O(nlog(n)).

The latitude and longitude attributes were converted to doubles (using
Double.parseDouble(String)) so that the comparisons worked properly.
